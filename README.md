# RL tutorial

This template repository is for developers creating new agents for [Upkie](https://github.com/tasts-robots/upkie) wheeled bipeds. All features from the main repository are available in Bazel via `@upkie` targets.

## Usage

- Create a new repository from this template.
- Search for the string "XXX": it indicates template values to adapt, such as the project name to change from ``"upkie_dev"`` to your own.
- The `Makefile` uploads your agent to the real robot.
